/// Asserts the wire document the model was built from comes back out of it unchanged — not merely
/// that serialization runs. Starting from JSON rather than from a constructed instance is what
/// makes one emitter cover both output modes: the legacy positional record and the fernMode
/// `required`/`init` record are constructed differently but deserialize from the same document, so
/// nothing here has to know which shape it is looking at. It is also the stronger assertion, since
/// a property whose C# name diverges from its wire name fails this and would pass a test that only
/// compared an instance to itself.
